## Summary
I am a captain of the **R.O.K. Airforce** and a Ph.D. student at **Korea University**. From 2018 to 2020, I worked as a researcher at **ADD** (Agency for Defense Development), where I focused on **automating binary analysis** through Symbolic Execution. From 2020 to 2022, I led the technical operations of the Blue Team in the **Cyber Operation Center of the R.O.K. Airforce**, where I was primarily responsible for defending military assets (PCs, servers, etc.) from cyber threats. My focus during this time was on **automating malware analysis and threat hunting**. Since 2023, I have been working in the **R.O.K. Cyber Operations Command**, performing Red Team operations to **identify and exploit vulnerabilities**. I’ve been tasked with finding vulnerabilities in all military service systems, including applications, servers, and network devices, where I have discovered several **zero-day** vulnerabilities. Additionally, I have won awards in various cyber security competitions, and through my graduate studies, I am currently researching intriguing topics related to live services in operation today.
